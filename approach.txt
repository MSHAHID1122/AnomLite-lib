Phase 1: No Deep Learning (yet)
Build classic models:

PCA-based anomaly detector

One-class SVM

Statistical texture comparison (histograms, entropy)

Patch-level scoring using similarity to normal patches

Use this to bootstrap your library.

Phase 2: Shallow CNN (your own, custom)
Build a shallow convolutional autoencoder in Python + C++:

2–3 convolutional layers

1–2 fully connected layers

No need for batchnorm, dropout, or advanced stuff yet.

Train on small datasets (healthy-only images) using your CPU.

Phase 3: Optional PyTorch Integration (for bigger models)
Later, allow users to plug in pretrained PyTorch models, if they want GPU power.
