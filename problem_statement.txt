Anomaly (or outlier) detection in medical imaging has certainly attracted 
attention—but compared to “mainstream” vision tasks (like classification or
segmentation), it remains a moderately explored niche, with most work concentrated
 in a few areas and plenty of gaps elsewhere. Here’s why:

1. Volume and Concentration of Research
A 2021 mini-review analyzed 120 papers on unsupervised and semi-supervised
 anomaly detection in medical imaging and found that most studies focus on brain MRI, 
 with far fewer addressing chest X-rays, OCT, or retinal scans

A 2024 comparative study benchmarked 30 methods across seven datasets and five 
modalities—again heaviest on MRI—highlighting that robust, modality-agnostic 
techniques are still lacking IET Research Journals
.
By contrast, classification and segmentation each have hundreds of dedicated papers 
per modality per year, whereas anomaly detection publications number only in the 
dozens annually, spread unevenly across tasks.

2. Why It’s Under-Explored in Some Modalities
Data Scarcity of “Purely Normal” Sets

Anomaly detection requires large collections of only healthy images to model normality.
Public repositories of normal chest X-rays or retinal OCT are smaller and less curated 
than MRI archives, so many researchers default to MRI arXiv
.

Evaluation Challenges

Without ground-truth labels for every possible anomaly, it’s hard to 
quantitatively compare methods. Benchmarks (like Brain Tumor Segmentation) 
provide clear labels; anomaly tasks do not.

Algorithmic Difficulty

Unsupervised methods (GANs, autoencoders, one-class SVMs) must capture the full 
variability of health—far harder than discriminating between two known classes. 
This extra complexity deters some researchers.

3. Why MRI Became the “Hotspot”
High-quality public datasets (e.g., BraTS for brain tumors) with standardized 
protocols make research easier.

Clear definitions of anomalies (tumors, lesions) allow straightforward evaluation.

Consequently, the majority of deep-learning anomaly-detection papers focus here,
 leaving modalities like chest X-ray or ophthalmology ripe for contribution

4. Opportunities in Less-Studied Areas
Chest X-ray & Retinal OCT: fewer dedicated unsupervised benchmarks; huge real-world 
impact.

Histopathology & Ultrasound: highly variable and data-scarce modalities where normal
 vs. abnormal is nuanced.

Cross-modality methods: building truly general anomaly detectors that work across
 MRI, X-ray, OCT would be novel.

Bottom Line
While anomaly detection in medical imaging has grown steadily—and several strong 
surveys and methods now exist—the 
field is still far from saturated, especially outside brain MRI. The combination 
of data scarcity, evaluation hurdles, 
and algorithmic complexity means many modalities and techniques remain
 under-researched, offering you a real chance
to make novel contributions without needing massive compute resources.
