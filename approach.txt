Phase 1: No Deep Learning (yet)
Build classic models:

PCA-based anomaly detector

One-class SVM

Statistical texture comparison (histograms, entropy)

Patch-level scoring using similarity to normal patches

Use this to bootstrap your library.

Phase 2: Shallow CNN (your own, custom)
Build a shallow convolutional autoencoder in Python + C++:

2–3 convolutional layers

1–2 fully connected layers

No need for batchnorm, dropout, or advanced stuff yet.

Train on small datasets (healthy-only images) using your CPU.

Phase 3: Optional PyTorch Integration (for bigger models)
Later, allow users to plug in pretrained PyTorch models, if they want GPU power.














PLAN::

1. Build a Strong Foundational Understanding
Start with comprehensive literature reviews to identify gaps and trends:

Key Papers to Prioritize:

Mini-Reviews (e.g., Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging — A Mini Review 137: These synthesize 120+ papers, highlighting MRI dominance and under-researched modalities like OCT/chest X-rays. Use this to target your niche.

Comparative Studies (e.g., MedIAnomaly 11): Analyze benchmarks for 30+ methods across 7 datasets to avoid pitfalls like biased evaluations.

State-of-the-Art Techniques:

PatchCL-AE 2: Patch-wise contrastive learning for local feature consistency.

MADGAN 9: GAN-based multi-slice reconstruction for subtle anomalies (e.g., Alzheimer’s).

SALAD 6: Self-supervised translation-consistent features for label-scarce scenarios.

Actionable Tips:

Use tools like Connected Papers or ResearchRabbit to map citation networks.

Focus on papers addressing data scarcity (e.g., synthetic anomaly generation in 29).

2. Prioritize Understudied Modalities
Target OCT, chest X-rays, and histopathology where research is sparse:

Data Collection Strategies:

Leverage public datasets:

Retinal OCT: OCT2017 11.

Chest X-rays: NIH ChestX-ray14 or CheXpert.

Use federated learning to aggregate hospital data without violating privacy 1.

Synthetic Data Generation:

Simulate lesions/artifacts (e.g., tumors in MRI via tumors.py 2).

Adopt GAN-based augmentation (e.g., MADGAN’s multi-slice synthesis 9).

Actionable Tips:

Partner with hospitals for access to unlabeled datasets (e.g., normal chest X-rays).

Use MONAI’s transforms for modality-specific preprocessing (e.g., 3D normalization for MRI).

3. Design Modality-Agnostic Algorithms
Focus on architectures that generalize across imaging types:

Reconstruction-Based Methods:

Autoencoders (AEs): Start with vanilla AEs as baselines, then integrate contrastive learning (e.g., PatchCL-AE 2).

GANs: Use MADGAN’s slice reconstruction for volumetric data 9 or f-AnoGAN for single-image anomalies 6.

Self-Supervised Learning:

Pre-train models using masked image modeling (e.g., SALAD’s structure similarity loss 6).

Leverage translation-consistent features to reduce pixel-level noise 6.

Actionable Tips:

Implement modular architectures (e.g., separate encoders for MRI/X-ray).

Use PyTorch Lightning for rapid experimentation with different backbones (VAEs, Transformers).

4. Address Evaluation Challenges
Develop robust metrics for label-scarce settings:

Anomaly Scoring:

Avoid pixel-level MSE; use semantic discrepancy (e.g., feature-space differences in PatchCL-AE 2).

Combine reconstruction error with uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian U-Net 3).

Benchmarking:

Test on diverse datasets (e.g., BraTS for tumors, OCT2017 for retinal anomalies 11).

Compare against simple baselines (e.g., z-score thresholds 3) to avoid overestimating performance.

Actionable Tips:

Use ROC-AUC for image-level detection and Dice score for pixel-level segmentation (if masks exist).

Publish benchmarks for understudied modalities to attract community contributions.

5. Optimize for Clinical Usability
Bridge the gap between research and real-world deployment:

Explainability Tools:

Integrate Grad-CAM or saliency maps to highlight anomalies for clinicians 26.

Use 3D volume slicers (e.g., volume_slicer.py 3) for interactive visualization.

Deployment:

Export models to ONNX/TorchScript for PACS integration 9.

Optimize inference speed with Cython for critical loops (e.g., histogram scoring 3).

Actionable Tips:

Collaborate with radiologists to validate heatmaps/UI designs.

Test on edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) for real-time inference in clinics.

6. Iterate with Open-Source Best Practices
Build a community-driven library:

Code Structure:

Follow the folder layout from your previous plan, ensuring modularity (e.g., models/autoencoders, data/synthetic).

Include Jupyter tutorials for chest X-ray/OCT workflows 3.

Community Engagement:

Publish pre-trained models on Hugging Face or Zenodo.

Host Kaggle competitions for anomaly detection on your benchmarks.

Actionable Tips:

Use GitHub Actions for automated testing/model deployment 3.

Adopt Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and hyperparameter tuning.

7. Validate with Real-World Case Studies
Test your library on impactful medical scenarios:

Early Disease Detection:

Reproduce MADGAN’s results on early-stage Alzheimer’s (AUC 0.727 9).

Extend to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using OCT or retinal scans.

Rare Anomalies:

Use synthetic data to simulate rare tumors in MRI/X-ray 29.

Apply one-class SVMs for histopathology (e.g., 3).

Actionable Tips:

Partner with research hospitals for clinical validation.

Publish case studies in journals like IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.
