🧠 1. Mathematics & Theory
These are essential for understanding anomaly detection and building efficient models:

✅ Must Know:
Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, PCA, SVD.

Probability & Statistics: Gaussian distribution, z-scores, KL divergence, mean/variance.

Optimization: Gradient descent, loss functions, regularization.

Information Theory (optional but helpful): Entropy, mutual information.

✅ Good to Understand:
Signal Processing: Especially 2D filters, convolution, edge detection.

Manifold Learning (optional): t-SNE, UMAP (for visualization or clustering).

💻 2. Programming Skills
✅ Python (Main Language)
NumPy, Pandas: For array ops and data processing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualization.

scikit-learn: For SVMs, PCA, evaluation metrics.

OpenCV / PIL: For image processing.

PyTorch or TensorFlow (lightweight use): For building autoencoders or neural models.

logging, argparse, typing: For clean code structure.

✅ C/C++ (for performance-critical modules)
Basic syntax, memory management.

How to create Python bindings using:

Cython

Pybind11

ctypes (lower level)

🧬 3. Machine Learning & Deep Learning
✅ Core ML Concepts:
Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Anomaly Detection (One-class SVM, Isolation Forest, etc.)

Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)

✅ Deep Learning (lightweight use only):
Autoencoders (basic, convolutional)

Reconstruction error analysis

Contrastive learning basics (e.g., SimCLR if doing patch-based contrast)

🖼️ 4. Computer Vision Basics
Image formats & preprocessing

Histogram equalization, normalization, resizing

Patch extraction and feature comparison

Texture features (GLCM, LBP, Haralick)

📚 5. Scientific Tools & Data
Familiarity with image datasets like:

NIH Chest X-ray

DRIVE (retinal)

DDSM (breast cancer mammograms)

Reading papers on unsupervised anomaly detection

arXiv, IEEE, NeurIPS, MICCAI

🧰 6. Software Engineering Skills
Virtual Environments (venv, conda)

Code Structuring (modular design)

Testing (pytest)

Version Control (Git + GitHub)

Documentation (README, docstrings, MkDocs/Sphinx)

📦 7. Packaging & Distribution
Building your library as a Python package (setup.py)

Writing a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml

Creating a CLI (argparse, click)

Possibly distributing on PyPI later

🧪 8. Evaluation Metrics & Analysis
AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Visualization of anomaly maps (heatmaps)

Threshold optimization techniques

✅ Bonus (for future scaling):
Docker (for reproducible environments)

FastAPI or Flask (if you want an API later)

React or Streamlit (if you want a simple front-end demo)
