Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging: 
Current Landscape and Opportunities
Anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a niche compared to 
mainstream tasks (e.g., classification/segmentation), with research heavily
 concentrated in brain MRI (53% of studies) and limited in modalities like 
 chest X-rays (10%), retinal OCT, and ultrasound. This imbalance stems from
  three core challenges:

Data Scarcity & Standardization: While large chest X-ray datasets exist 
(e.g.,RSNA, VinDr-CXR), they historically lacked the curated "purely normal"
  volumes and standardized protocols available for brain MRI (e.g., BraTS).

Evaluation Complexity: 
Brain MRI benefits from clear pixel-level anomaly labels (e.g., tumors). 
Chest X-rays often lack consistent annotations, making quantitative benchmarking 
difficult.

Algorithmic Difficulty: 
Modeling the full spectrum of "normal" is inherently harder in highly variable 
modalities (e.g., chest X-rays vs. MRI).

Recent shifts are closing gaps:

New benchmarks (e.g., MedIAnomaly 2024) and datasets now enable robust chest 
X-ray anomaly detection research.

Studies like MICCAI 2024’s position-guided prompt learning demonstrate 
accelerating progress beyond MRI.

Untapped opportunities exist in:

Chest X-ray & Ophthalmology: Developing tailored methods for their unique
noise, artifacts, and pathology diversity.

Cross-Modality Generalization: Creating anomaly detectors that transfer
 across MRI, X-ray, and OCT.

Evaluation Frameworks: Standardizing metrics for label-scarce 
environments.

Conclusion: Though brain MRI remains the best-established domain, 
chest X-ray anomaly detection is rapidly evolving. Novel contributions are 
feasible—especially in leveraging emerging benchmarks, improving evaluation,
 and designing modality-agnostic solutions—without requiring massive 
 computational resources.
